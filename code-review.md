**Score: 7/10** - Good version control practices.

---

## Critical Weaknesses (What Would Fail Code Review)

### ❌ 1. Massive Monolithic Component (CRITICAL)
**File:** `app/calendar/page.tsx` (1,840 lines)

**The Problem:**
```typescript
export default function Home() {
  // 20+ useState hooks
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('home');
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(new Date(2026, 3, 2));
  const [indicators, setIndicators] = useState<Indicator[]>([...]);
  const [isEditingIndicators, setIsEditingIndicators] = useState(false);
  const [showDatePicker, setShowDatePicker] = useState(false);
  // ... 15+ more state variables

  // All business logic, UI, and state management in one place
  // 1,840 lines of mixed concerns
}
```

**Why This Fails:**
- Violates Single Responsibility Principle
- Impossible to unit test effectively
- Difficult to maintain or debug
- Poor code reusability
- Performance issues (entire component re-renders)
- Merge conflicts guaranteed in team environment

**Score: 2/10** - This alone would block production deployment.

### ❌ 2. No Component Architecture
**The Problem:** Zero component extraction. Everything is inline JSX in one file.

**What's Missing:**
```
components/
  ├─ Calendar/
  │  ├─ CalendarGrid.tsx
  │  ├─ CalendarEvent.tsx
  │  ├─ EventForm.tsx
  │  ├─ TimeSlot.tsx
  │  └─ WeekNavigation.tsx
  ├─ Modals/
  │  ├─ DatePickerModal.tsx
  │  ├─ EventDetailsModal.tsx
  │  └─ UpgradeModal.tsx
  └─ Indicators/
     ├─ IndicatorCard.tsx
     └─ IndicatorList.tsx
```

**Score: 2/10** - No separation of concerns.

### ❌ 3. State Management Chaos
**The Problem:** 20+ useState hooks in one component with no state management library.

**What Should Exist:**
- Context API or Zustand for global state
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Separation of UI state vs. business state
- Proper state colocation

**Example of What's Wrong:**
```typescript
// All mixed together - UI state, business state, form state
const [events, setEvents] = useState<Event[]>([]);
const [showEventMenu, setShowEventMenu] = useState(false);
const [draggedEvent, setDraggedEvent] = useState<Event | null>(null);
const [dragStartY, setDragStartY] = useState(0);
const [dragCurrentY, setDragCurrentY] = useState(0);
// ... 15 more useState calls
```

**Score: 3/10** - Unmanageable state architecture.

### ❌ 4. No Type Safety Beyond Basics
**The Problem:** TypeScript is used, but not leveraged properly.

**What's Missing:**
- Zod or Yup for runtime validation
- Proper API response types
- Form validation schemas
- Type guards for user input
- Strict mode enabled

**Example:**
```typescript
// Current: Any data structure works
const body = await request.json()
const { title, notes, start_time, end_time } = body

// Should be:
import { z } from 'zod';

const EventSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  notes: z.string().optional(),
  start_time: z.string().datetime(),
  end_time: z.string().datetime(),
});

const body = EventSchema.parse(await request.json());
```

**Score: 4/10** - Basic types but no validation.

### ❌ 5. No Testing
**What's Missing:**
- Zero unit tests
- Zero integration tests
- Zero E2E tests
- No test infrastructure

**In a world-class shop, you'd have:**
```
tests/
  ├─ unit/
  │  ├─ components/
  │  ├─ hooks/
  │  └─ utils/
  ├─ integration/
  │  └─ api/
  └─ e2e/
     └─ calendar-flow.spec.ts
```

**Score: 0/10** - No tests = not production ready.

### ❌ 6. Security & Validation Gaps
**Issues:**
- No rate limiting on API routes
- No input sanitization
- No CSRF protection
- API routes trust all input
- No request size limits
- Secrets in client-side code (price IDs)

**Score: 3/10** - Basic auth but many vulnerabilities.

### ❌ 7. Performance Issues
**Problems:**
- 1,840 line component re-renders entirely on any state change
- No memoization (useMemo, useCallback)
- No code splitting
- No lazy loading
- All modals loaded upfront even when hidden
- No virtualization for long lists

**Score: 3/10** - Will be slow with real data.

### ❌ 8. Accessibility
**What's Missing:**
- No ARIA labels
- No keyboard navigation
- No screen reader support
- No focus management
- Color contrast issues
- No semantic HTML

**Score: 2/10** - Would fail accessibility audit.

### ❌ 9. Error Handling
**Issues:**
- Generic `alert()` for errors (unprofessional)
- No error boundaries
- No retry logic
- No offline support
- Silent failures in some places
- Console.error instead of proper logging

**Current:**
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to save event:', error);
  alert('Failed to save event. Please try again.'); // ❌ Using alert()
}
```

**Should be:**
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to save event', { error, userId, eventId });
  toast.error('Unable to save event. Please try again.', {
    action: { label: 'Retry', onClick: handleRetry }
  });
}
```

**Score: 4/10** - Basic error handling but not user-friendly.

### ❌ 10. Code Organization
**Structure Issues:**
- No hooks directory
- No utils properly separated
- No constants file
- Magic numbers and strings everywhere
- Business logic mixed with UI

**Score: 3/10** - Poor organization.

---

## What Would Need to Change for a World-Class Shop

### 🏗️ Architecture Refactor (P0 - Critical)

1. **Break up the monolith:**
   ```
   app/calendar/
   ├─ page.tsx (50-100 lines max)
   ├─ components/
   │  ├─ CalendarView/
   │  ├─ EventModals/
   │  └─ Navigation/
   ├─ hooks/
   │  ├─ useEvents.ts
   │  ├─ useCalendar.ts
   │  └─ useDragDrop.ts
   └─ lib/
      ├─ calendar-utils.ts
      └─ constants.ts
   ```

2. **Extract business logic:**
   - Custom hooks for all data fetching
   - Separate presentational from container components
   - Move calculations to utility functions

3. **Implement proper state management:**
   ```typescript
   // Zustand store example
   const useCalendarStore = create<CalendarState>((set) => ({
     events: [],
     selectedDate: new Date(),
     addEvent: (event) => set((state) => ({
       events: [...state.events, event]
     })),
     // ... proper state management
   }));
   ```

### 🧪 Testing Infrastructure (P0 - Critical)

1. **Set up testing:**
   ```bash
   # Required
   - Vitest for unit tests
   - React Testing Library
   - Playwright for E2E
   - MSW for API mocking
   ```

2. **Coverage requirements:**
   - 80% unit test coverage minimum
   - All API routes tested
   - Critical user flows in E2E

### 🔒 Security Hardening (P0 - Critical)

1. **Input validation:**
   ```typescript
   import { z } from 'zod';

   const EventCreateSchema = z.object({
     title: z.string().min(1).max(200),
     start_time: z.string().datetime(),
     end_time: z.string().datetime(),
   }).refine(
     (data) => new Date(data.end_time) > new Date(data.start_time),
     { message: "End time must be after start time" }
   );
   ```

2. **Rate limiting:**
   ```typescript
   import { ratelimit } from '@/lib/redis';

   export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
     const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(userId);
     if (!success) return new Response('Too Many Requests', { status: 429 });
     // ... handle request
   }
   ```

3. **CSRF protection, request size limits, proper secrets management**

### ♿ Accessibility (P1 - High Priority)

1. **Semantic HTML:**
   ```tsx
   <nav aria-label="Calendar navigation">
     <button aria-label="Previous week" onClick={previousWeek}>
       <ChevronLeft aria-hidden="true" />
     </button>
   </nav>
   ```

2. **Keyboard navigation:**
   ```tsx
   <div
     role="grid"
     aria-label="Calendar"
     onKeyDown={handleKeyboardNavigation}
   >
   ```

3. **Screen reader support, focus management, color contrast fixes**

### ⚡ Performance (P1 - High Priority)

1. **Component optimization:**
   ```typescript
   const CalendarGrid = memo(({ events, date }) => {
     const memoizedEvents = useMemo(
       () => filterEventsByDate(events, date),
       [events, date]
     );
     // ...
   });
   ```

2. **Code splitting:**
   ```typescript
   const UpgradeModal = lazy(() => import('./components/UpgradeModal'));
   const EventForm = lazy(() => import('./components/EventForm'));
   ```

3. **Virtualization for event lists, image optimization, bundle analysis**

### 📊 Observability (P2 - Medium Priority)

1. **Proper logging:**
   ```typescript
   import { logger } from '@/lib/logger';

   logger.info('Event created', { eventId, userId, metadata });
   logger.error('Failed to create event', { error, context });
   ```

2. **Error tracking:** Sentry integration
3. **Analytics:** PostHog or similar
4. **Performance monitoring:** Vercel Analytics + custom metrics

### 📝 Documentation (P2 - Medium Priority)

1. **README with:**
   - Architecture overview
   - Setup instructions
   - Development workflow
   - Deployment guide

2. **Code documentation:**
   - JSDoc for complex functions
   - API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
   - Component Storybook

3. **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)** for major choices
